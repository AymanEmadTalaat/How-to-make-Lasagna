This is a basic website on how to make a Lasagna.

1- implemented the side menu using the position property, and set it to fixed.

2- used css variables to insert some colors.

3- used basic flex box to make space between the header(side menu) and the main section.

4- added two media queries that make the webpage resposnsive. The first is applied when the webpage is 900px wide or less, the second is applied when the webpage is 700px wide or less
